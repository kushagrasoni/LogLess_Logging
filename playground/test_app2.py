    # Measurements for overhead As a extended feature, ONLY for Idempotent functions production version without
    # settrace, run the function twice, First time to check if there is any exception , then if thereis an exception,
    # run the decorated function with logless and log the exception
    # Make arguments to work stronger.
    # Why static analysis is not enough and why we want to use runtime tracing?
    # Logical argument and back it up with good references

    # Find shortcoming of static analysis
    # find example of dynamic object creation in serverless applications

    # Find some benchmarking tools for execution times
