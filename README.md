# LogLess

**LogLess** is an automated and hassle-free logging mechanism that generates logs of serverless applications for developers.
 
There automated logs can be used by developers for tracking the execution workflow and debugging without writing any logging statements manually.

### For Serverless Platforms
Current logging mechanisms in serverless platforms can sometimes become cumbersome for developers. 
In case of any failures or debugging, spotting the issues can become difficult due to inadequate logging. 

Additionally, the auto-generated system-wide logs, by cloud platforms, are not descriptive enough to help debug an application error. 
There are indeed some logging tools and utilities available in the market, which can be configured to an applicationâ€™s needs. 
However, they still need developers to write the logging statements apart from the code.

### Serverless & Beyond...
Apart from Serverless application, LogLess can be conveniently used for logging any Python based application.
